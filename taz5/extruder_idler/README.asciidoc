= extruder_idler

The TAZ 5 extruder idler is a part that holds a 608 bearing that presses
the filament against the nurled bolt that pushes the filament into the
print head.

According to a Lulz service bulletin, the extruder idler is prone to
cracking during the manufacturing process. The TAZ 5 at Robot Garden
had its extruder idler crack within a month or two. On July 31, 2016,
it was replaced. The stock idler design makes it very difficult to
insert the 608 bearing. The modified design here shaves a little off
the stock part, making the bearing installation much easier.
